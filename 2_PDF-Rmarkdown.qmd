# PDF using Rmarkdown via the `bookdown` package {#sec-rmarkdown-pdf}

## Preparation

Before diving in, please do the followings:

+ Go [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/l95j7vk8sxl2nnu/AAAwWMl8yO6Vbj0u_9zd_fv6a?dl=0) and download all the files including **sample_to_word.rmd**, which we refer to as the sample rmd file throughout this chapter. Alternatively, you can clone this [Github repository](https://github.com/tmieno2/WritingJournalArticleRmarkdown).

+ Knit **sample_to_word.Rmd** to produce **sample_to_word.docx**, which we refer to as the sample WORD file.

+ Install the following packages if you have not
  + `officedown`
  + `flextable`
  + `officer`
  + `knitr`
  + `rmarkdown`
  + `tidyverse`
  + `modelsummary`

## Tables

`tab.cap` does not work

:::{.callout-tips}
+ Create the title of the table using R because you cannot add a title using `tab.cap` unlike adding a title to a figure using `fig.cap`.

### Basics
You can fully take advantage of Latex math typesetting capability unlike the Rmarkdown-WORD system. This is because whatever you type inside of the following will be printed as is in the tex file when rmd file is converted to a tex file.

````{verbatim}
```{=tex}
whatever you type
```
````

So, for example, if you have the following in your rmd file, 

````{verbatim}
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \varepsilon
\end{equation}
```
````

then you will the following printed in the tex file,

````{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \varepsilon
\end{equation}
````

, which will then appear as 

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \varepsilon
\end{equation}
```

in the compiled pdf file.

Of course, you can use other environments like `align`,

````{verbatim}
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
Y_z & = f_z(S) + g_z(N) + h_z(X,Y) + \varepsilon_z\notag \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^k \phi_k(S) + g_z(N) + h_z(X,Y) + \varepsilon_z
\end{align}
```
````

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
Y_z & = f_z(S) + g_z(N) + h_z(X,Y) + \varepsilon_z\notag \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^k \phi_k(S) + g_z(N) + h_z(X,Y) + \varepsilon_z
\end{align}
```

### Cross-reference

There are two ways to cross-reference equations. The first option is to place `(\#eq:equation-name)` at the end of the line that you would like to cross-reference. For example, `(\#eq:eqn1)` is placed at the end of the equation below.

````{verbatim}
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \varepsilon (\#eq:eqn1)
\end{equation}
```
````

You can then write `\@ref(eq:eqn1)` to refer to the equation number.

knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/math-bookdown-rmd.png")
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/math-bookdown-pdf.png")
```

Alternatively, you can do cross-reference as if you would do in a tex file. Specifically, you can add `\label{equation-name}` at the end of the line and then write `\ref{equation-name}`.

````{verbatim}
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \varepsilon \label{eq-tex}
\end{equation}
```
````

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="minimal" collapse="true"}

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "100%"}

knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/math-bookdown-latex-way-2.png")
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/math-bookdown-latex-way-1.png")
```

Just like Latex, you can use `\notag` to suppress equation numbers. You can cross-reference individual lines.

````{verbatim}
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
Y_z & = f_z(S) + g_z(N) + h_z(X,Y) + \varepsilon_z \notag \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^k \phi_k(S) + g_z(N) + h_z(X,Y) + \varepsilon_z (\#eq:al-second)
\end{align}
```

Equation \@ref(eq:al-second) is the second line.
