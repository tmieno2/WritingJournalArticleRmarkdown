Fairly new to the academic world, I was using R to create reports for econometrics courses or writing manuscripts before I learned how to use Latex.\n\nRun R codes and create tables (regression results, summary statistics, etc) on R, take a screenshot of the tables on R, save them as pictures\nRun R codes and create plots on R, save the plots as pictures\nImport tables and figures manually to the WORD file\nFormat tables manually on WORD\n\nThese are extremely tedious and time-consuming. When something changes (underlying data, parameter, etc), then you need to start the process all over again every time. You are probebly well aware that these changes are rather common during the process of completing a project with the final goal being publising a paper.\nThe arrival of the knitr and Rmarkdown packages have completely changed the game because you can now integrate narratives and R codes in a single file. When you knit (compile) the file, then you have everything you need in the output file in various formats (WORD, pdf, html).\nThe Rmarkdown system is now mature enough that we can write an academic manuscript in both PDF and WORD (more clumsy, but acceptable). This book provides introduction of how to do so.",

But, please do check yourself if it is required)\nIterate between the authors until ready for submission\nSubmit your manuscript (no formatting just yet)\nRevise and resubmit your manuscript after iterating between the authors (the same as step 2)\nRepeat steps 2, 3, and 4 until accepted (terminate the process if rejected)\nFinally, format your manuscript to the specific requirements by the journal\n\ncreate a style reference WORD file and refer to it (see Section Section 3.6).\nmodify the format manually on WORD if that is faster\n\n\nNow, let’s take a closer look at Step 2. What you do in this step differs based on who your co-authors are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 1: one of your co-authors demands a WORD file for editing for him/herself\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, you knit to WORD and give the output WORD file to those authors, let them edit in WORD, and then you need to reflect the changes suggested in the WORD file to the Rmarkdown file. The last step would not exist if you are writing in WORD exclusively. However, I did not find this painful personally. Rather, this forces me to carefully inspect all the changes made by co-authors (, which of course you should do even if you are using WORD alone).\nOnce you modify the Rmarkdown file and knit to WORD, all the track changes will be lost. For the co-authors who want to see the changes you made from the previous version, simply suggest taking advantage of WORD’s capability to compare two versions of a document (see here). If they complain about doing this, just stop working with them entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 2: every single one of the authors knows how to use Rmarkdown and git\n\n\n\nIn this case, things are just so much easier. You never have to get out of Rmarkdown. Just let them edit the Rmarkdown file and keep track of changes using git. Any IDE should give you a side-by-side comparison of the previous and current versions like below (Sublime Merge is used here).",

For example, you can determine the page size and margins using page_size and page_margins (see the YAML header in the sample rmd file). You also have some controls on how tables and figures appear. For example, the align option lets you determine the horizontal position of tables and figures. topcaption lets you determine whether you have the caption at the top of bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor the complete set of options, see Section 4 of the Officeverse book.\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Change styles through reference docx\nIt is almost always the case that the above approach is not sufficient to format your WORD file to the specific requirements of your target journal. In such a case, you can define the style of the output WORD file in detail using a style reference WORD file. This method can control virtually every aspect of WORD file styling. Some of the commonly customized elements among others are\n\nfont size\nfont family\nline spacing\n\nTo do this, you first create a style reference word file that follows the style and format you would like the output WORD file to have. Then, add the following to the YAML header under output: like below.\n\noutput:\n  reference_docx: word-style.docx\n\nIn our example project, word_template.docx is the reference file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, only the style and format of the reference WORD file will be inherited to the output WORD file, but not its contents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nCompared the style of sample_to_word.docx and “word_template.docx” and confirm they have the same font size and family for the narrative, sections, subsections, and subsubsection.\nUncomment reference_docx: word_template.docx in the YAML header, knit to a WORD file, and check the style of sample_to_word.dcox again\n\n\n\nYou can change the style of the reference WORD style file and save the changes. Then, the style changes will be reflected in the output WORD file when the rmd file is knitted next time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo create a style file for your liking you may find this Microsoft tutorial and this book chapter in (xie2020r?) useful.\n\n\n\n\n3.6.3 Style change example\nThis section gives you a quick look at what it may look to be changing the style of a reference WORD file. We use word_template.docx for this demonstration. First, open the document on WORD and open the Styles Pane (If you are using Mac, it should be at the right upper corner of the document). Then you should see something like below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, put your cursor on anywhere in line 2 as below and you should see that the current style is changed to “1 Heading 1”, which is the name of the class (style type) the texts in line 2 belong to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, put your cursor at the black triangle and you should see available options including “Modify Style…”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you click on it, you should see a pop-up window like below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, you can change font family, font size, among other things. In this demonstration, let’s get rid of automatic section number. To do so, click on the “Format” button at the lower left corner of the window. Then, you should see this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPick “Numbering,” click on “None,” and hit “OK.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit “OK” again in the previous pop-up window, then you should see this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that section numbering is now gone. Now, knit the sample rmd file and confirm that the output WORD file indeed lost section numbers (subsection numbers still remain because you did not modify that part in the reference docx.).",

This is because PNAS uses only numbers, but not author names or years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation style for PNAS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style for PNAS",

Cross-referencing would not work if the table id includes _.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nSee the Tables section of the sample rmd for the R codes to create a table using the flextable package and confirm that the table appears in the output WORD files\nSee the bottom of the Data subsection under the Materials and Methods section to confirm that cross-referencing is working.\n\n\n\n\n3.8.1 Packages to create tables\nOne of the disadvantages of writing to a WORD file is that some table-making R packages are not compatible with it. The flextable package is written by the same author of the officedown package, which we are using to write to a WORD file. So, naturally, a table object created by the flextable package (a flextable object) can be knitted into the output WORD without (almost) any hiccups as we saw earlier. A notable R package that does NOT work well with the output class of officedown::rdocx_document (which we are using) is the gt package. Tables created by the package is an object of class gt. Unfortunately, there is no function that lets you convert an gt object to a flextable object as of now.\nOne of the recommended packages is the modelsummary package (especially for those who often include regression results tables and summary statistics tables). It lets you create regression results tables via the modelsummary() function and summary statistics tables via the datasummary() function1. Both functions has an option called output and you can use output = \"flextable\" to generate tables as flextable objects, which can then be included in the output file easily.\nHere are some example R codes of using the modelsummary package to create a regression results and summary statistics tables.\nRegression table\n\n#--- regressions ---#\nlm_1 &lt;- fixest::feols(mpg ~ hp + cyl, data = mtcars)\nlm_2 &lt;- fixest::feols(mpg ~ hp + cyl + wt, data = mtcars)\nlm_3 &lt;- fixest::feols(mpg ~ hp + cyl + wt, cluster = ~ vs, data = mtcars)\n\n#--- create a regression results table ---#\nmodelsummary::modelsummary(\n  list(lm_1, lm_2, lm_3),\n  output = \"flextable\",\n  gof_omit = \"IC|Log|Adj|F|Pseudo|Within\"\n) %&gt;%\n  autofit() %&gt;%\n  hline(8) # add horizontal line. modelsummary() adds horizontal line separating coefficient estimates and model summary statistics. But, it disappears on WORD for some reason. So, it is manually added here.\n\nSummary statistics table\n\nmodelsummary::datasummary(\n  mpg + hp + cyl ~ Mean + SD,\n  data = mtcars,\n  output = \"flextable\"\n)\n\nHere is one of the resources to learn how to use the flextable package if you need to further modify the tables created by the modelsummary() and datasummary() functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSee how the exactly the same codes above in the sample rmd file translates into the regression results and summary statistics tables in the output word file.",

Cross-referencing would not work if the table id includes _.\n\n\n\nYou can control the size of the plots in the output WORD file, using the fig.width and fig.height options in the R code chunk. For example, fig.width = 4 would mean that the width of the plot will be 4 inches. Use the dpi option to control the resolution of the plot. The higher the dpi value, the sharper the plot is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry\n\n\n\n\nChange fig.width to 2 and see what happens to the output WORD file.\nRemove the fig.cap option and see what happens to the output WORD file.\nChange the dpi value to 100 see what happens to the output WORD file.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.9.2 Importing pre-made figures\nInstead of creating plots using R code inside an Rmarkdown, we often need to import figures that were made elsewhere. You may be importing your company/university logos. You may have created plots using the ggplot2 package and saved them as pictures. In order to import a pre-made figure and cross-reference it, you can use knitr::include_graphics() as follows,\n```{r  echo = F, fig.id = \"figure-id\", fig.cap = \"figure caption\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"file name\")\n```\nYou can cross-reference imported figures in the same manner as the R-generated figures as shown above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRmarkdown-WORD Comparison: Visual Example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRmarkdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWORD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that pdf files are not accepted2. One of the accepted files types is .png (or jpg)3. So, if you are creating figures outside of the Rmarkdown file, save it as a png file.\nIn order to change the size of the imported figure, you can use the same R chunk option of fig.width and fig.height as the internally created plots. However, you cannot control the resolution of the imported figure using dpi (naturally) because the resolution of the saved image will be respected. If you are using R to create a plot, you can set its dpi when saving it. For example, if you are using ggplot2, you can the dpi option in ggsave() will do the job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry!\n\n\n\n\nChange fig.width = 3 to see its effect on the output WORD file\nChange dpi = 600 in the R code chunk for the second figure to confirmt that it does not anything",

This is because Latex is NOT involved in converting Latex-like math syntax to math equations when knitted to WORD. Instead, pandoc is doing the conversion job. So, it is not surprising that not all the Latex math capabilities can be utilized when knitting to a WORD file. With that said, most of the syntaxes that you will need are the same between Rmd-to-WORD and Latex. You can use the equation (for single line of math) and align (more than equal to one equations) environments with successful cross-referencing.\n\nequation environment\nTo use an equation environment, first write math and then put (\\#eq:equation-id) at the end (but before \\end{equation}) to give an equation id to the equation.

This is because whatever you type inside of the following will be printed as is in the tex file when rmd file is converted to a tex file.\n```{=tex}\nwhatever you type\n```\nSo, for example, if you have the following in your rmd file,\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{equation}\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\varepsilon\n\\end{equation}\n```\nthen you will the following printed in the tex file,\n\\begin{equation}\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\varepsilon\n\\end{equation}\n, which will then appear as\n\\[\\begin{equation}\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\varepsilon\n\\end{equation}\\]\nin the compiled pdf file.\nOf course, you can use other environments like align,\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align}\nY_z & = f_z(S) + g_z(N) + h_z(X,Y) + \\varepsilon_z\\notag \\\\\n& = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\phi_k(S) + g_z(N) + h_z(X,Y) + \\varepsilon_z\n\\end{align}\n```\n\\[\\begin{align}\nY_z & = f_z(S) + g_z(N) + h_z(X,Y) + \\varepsilon_z\\notag \\\\\n& = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\phi_k(S) + g_z(N) + h_z(X,Y) + \\varepsilon_z\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n4.4.2 Cross-reference\nThere are two ways to cross-reference equations. The first option is to place (\\#eq:equation-name) at the end of the line that you would like to cross-reference. For example, (\\#eq:eqn1) is placed at the end of the equation below.\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{equation}\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\varepsilon (\\#eq:eqn1)\n\\end{equation}\n```\nYou can then write \\@ref(eq:eqn1) to refer to the equation number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRmarkdown-Latex Comparison: Visual Example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can do cross-reference as if you would do in a tex file. Specifically, you can add \\label{equation-name} at the end of the line and then write \\ref{equation-name}.\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{equation}\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\varepsilon \\label{eq-tex}\n\\end{equation}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRmarkdown-Latex Comparison: Visual Example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust like Latex, you can use \\notag to suppress equation numbers.

For example, you can use the kableExtra and huxtable package to create tables from a data.frame-like R objects from scratch. Here is an example code using the huxtable package.\n\nlibrary(huxtable)\n  head(iris, 10) %&gt;%\n  # Create a huxtable\n  as_hux() %&gt;%\n  # Add some basic styling\n  set_background_color(row = 1, value = \"lightgray\") # Background color for header\n\n\n\n\nSepal.Length\nSepal.Width\nPetal.Length\nPetal.Width\nSpecies\n\n\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3  \n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5  \n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.4\n3.9\n1.7\n0.4\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.4\n1.4\n0.3\nsetosa\n\n\n5  \n3.4\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.4\n2.9\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3.1\n1.5\n0.1\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gt package does not work as well with Latex as it does with the html output1. In academic journals, fancy looking tables are not necessary. kableExtra and huxtable are likely to be very much sufficient. Here is an example of a table created by kableExtra.\n\n\n\n5.3.1.2 Regressions results and summary tables\nFor regression results and summary statics, the modelsummary and gtsummary2 packages are particularly convenient and useful. For example, the modelsummary package lets you create regression results and summary statistics tables via the modelsummary() function and summary statistics tables via the datasummary() function3. For the gtsummary package, their respective corresponding functions are tbl_regression and tbl_summary. For regression results tables, the stargazer package is also a viable option. It is less capable in creating summary statistics tables than modelsummary and gtsummary.\nHere are example R codes of using the modelsummary package to create regression results and summary statistics tables.\nRegression table\n\n#--- regressions ---#\nlm_1 &lt;- fixest::feols(mpg ~ hp + cyl, data = mtcars)\nlm_2 &lt;- fixest::feols(mpg ~ hp + cyl + wt, data = mtcars)\nlm_3 &lt;- fixest::feols(mpg ~ hp + cyl + wt, cluster = ~ vs, data = mtcars)\n\n#--- create a regression results table ---#\nmodelsummary::modelsummary(\n  list(lm_1, lm_2, lm_3),\n  gof_omit = \"IC|Log|Adj|F|Pseudo|Within\"\n)\n\nThis is how the table would appear on the output PDF file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary statistics table\n\nmodelsummary::datasummary(\n  mpg + hp + cyl ~ Mean + SD,\n  data = mtcars\n)\n\nThis is how the table would appear on the output PDF file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.1.3 Further modifying regression and summary statistics tables\nYou can modify (fine-tune) the output of modelsummary or gtsummary using the huxtable package if you are not satisfied. For the modelsummary package, this can be done by using output = \"huxtable\" and then use huxtable functions for modifications. Here is an example code.\n\nlibrary(huxtable)\n\nmodelsummary(list(lm_1, lm_2, lm_3),\n output = \"huxtable\",\n gof_omit = \"IC|Log|Adj|F|Pseudo|Within\",\n stars = TRUE\n) %&gt;%\n# Bold the header row\n# set_bold(row = 1) %&gt;%\n# Border at the bottom of the table\nset_bottom_border(row = nrow(.), value = 0.4) %&gt;%\n# Center-align the header\nset_align(1, everywhere, value = \"center\") %&gt;%\n# Set font size to 10\nset_font_size(value = 10) \n\nFor the gtsummary package, you can apply as_hux_table() and then modify the table.\nHere is an example code for using the kableExtra package.\n\nmodelsummary(list(lm_1, lm_2, lm_3),\n  output = \"kableExtra\",\n  gof_omit = \"IC|Log|Adj|F|Pseudo|Within\",\n  stars = TRUE\n) %&gt;%\n  kableExtra::add_header_above(\n    c(\" \" = 1, \"Model (se not clustered) \" = 2, \"Model (se clustered)\" = 1)\n  )",

In order to import a pre-made figure and cross-reference it, you can use knitr::include_graphics() as follows,\n```{r  echo = F, fig.id = \"figure-id\", fig.cap = \"figure caption\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"file name\")\n```\nYou can cross-reference imported figures in the same manner as the R-generated figures as shown above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nqmd-PDF Comparison: Visual Example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRmarkdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWORD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Figure placement\n\n\n5.4.4 Change the size of the figure\nYou can control the size of the plots in the output PDF file using the out.width or out.height option in the R code chunk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry\n\n\n\n\nChange out.width to 2 and see what happens to the output WORD file.\nRemove the fig.cap option and see what happens to the output WORD file.\nChange the dpi value to 100 see what happens to the output WORD file.",

However, the complexity of equations that can be written in this manner is rather limited. As of now (2023-09-29), if you try this way of cross-referencing for environments like align, it would not work.\nThis one works.\n```{=tex}\n$$\n\\bar{y} = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\n$$ {#eq-simple}\n```\nBut, this one would not (Try it yourself. It is not tested in our sample qmd file because it would cause a compilation error.).\n```{=tex}\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n AR(p): Y_i &= c + \\epsilon_i + \\phi_i Y_{i-1} \\dots \\\\\n Y_{i} &= c + \\phi_i Y_{i-1} \\dots\n\\end{align}\n$$ {#eq-align}\n```\nThis one neither.\n```{=tex}\n$$\n AR(p): Y_i &= c + \\epsilon_i + \\phi_i Y_{i-1} \\dots \\\\\n Y_{i} &= c + \\phi_i Y_{i-1} \\dots\n$$ {#eq-align}\n```\nInstead, we could cross-reference equations the Latex way, taking full advantage of the fact that raw tex codes are accepted. For example, this would work.\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align}\nY_z & = f_z(S) + g_z(N) + h_z(X,Y) + \\varepsilon_z \\notag \\\\\n& = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\phi_k(S) + g_z(N) + h_z(X,Y) + \\varepsilon_z \\label{eq-align}\n\\end{align}\n```\nThen, use \\ref{eq-align} to cross-reference it.
