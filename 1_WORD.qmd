## Before you start 

:::{.callout-important}
## What you need to know/learn

In order for you to be able to write a complete journal article without touching WORD, you will need to know/learn the following.

+ How Rmarkdown works ([This](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) or [This](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html) is a good place to start) 
+ How to write mathematical expressions using Latex(-like) syntax ([This](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions) can be a good start)
+ Create figures using R (any R pacakge, like `ggplot2`)
+ Create talbes using R with select R pacakges that are compatible with WORD output (e.g., `flextable`, `modelsummary`, `gtsummary`)

Please think carfully about the cost of learning all these skills before you invest you time in reading this chapter. 
:::

## Preparation

Before diving in, please do the followings:

+ Go [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kamcegpis7m0pzq/AAAdZ2eo1vhaZ7srxDLNHdMoa?dl=0) and download all the files including **sample_to_word.rmd**, which we refer to as the sample rmd file throughout this chapter. Alternatively, you can clone this [Github repository](https://github.com/tmieno2/WritingJournalArticleRmarkdown) and go to the **Resources/WORD/** folder.

+ Open RStudio (or any other software you you may be using like VS code) and knit **sample_to_word.Rmd** to produce **sample_to_word.docx**, which we refer to as the sample WORD file.

+ Install the following packages if you have not
  + `officedown`
  + `flextable`
  + `officer`
  + `knitr`
  + `Rmarkdown`
  + `tidyverse`
  + `modelsummary`

## Baisc workflow until publication

Here are the proposed steps to generate a fully publication-ready article:

1. Write an Rmarkdown file and knit to a WORD file without worrying about formatting your manuscript (Most journals do not require manuscript formatting until the manuscript is accepted. But, please do check yourself if it is required)
2. Iterate between the authors until ready for submission
3. Submit your manuscript (no formatting just yet)
4. Revise and resubmit your manuscript after iterating between the authors (the same as step 2)
5. Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 until accepted (terminate the process if rejected)
6. Finally, format your manuscript to the specific requirements by the journal
   + create a style reference WORD file and refer to it (see Section @sec-word-specify-style).
   + modify the format manually on WORD if that is faster

Now, let's take a closer look at Step 2. What you do in this step differs based on who your co-authors are. 

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## Case 1: one of your co-authors demands a WORD file for editing for him/herself

+ In this case, you knit to WORD and give the output WORD file to those authors, let them edit in WORD, and then **you need to reflect the changes suggested in the WORD file to the Rmarkdown file**. The last step would not exist if you are writing in WORD exclusively. However, I did not find this painful personally. Rather, this forces me to carefully inspect all the changes made by co-authors (, which of course you should do even if you are using WORD alone). 
+ Once you modify the Rmarkdown file and knit to WORD, all the track changes will be lost. For the co-authors who want to see the changes you made from the previous version, simply suggest taking advantage of WORD's capability to compare two versions of a document (see [here](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-compare-two-word-documents)). If they complain about doing this, just stop working with them entirely. 
:::

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## Case 2: every single one of the authors knows how to use Rmarkdown and git 

In this case, things are just so much easier. You never have to get out of Rmarkdown. Just let them edit the Rmarkdown file and keep track of changes using git. Any IDE should give you a side-by-side comparison of the previous and current versions like below ([Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) is used here).


```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/git-illustrate.png")
```
:::


## Structure of the Rmarkdown file

The ramrkdown file consits mainly of two components.

+ YAML header
+ Main body

### YAML header

YAML header comes at the very top of the Rmarkdown file and it lets you specify things like

+ paper title
+ authors
+ date
+ abstract

It also lets you specify various aspects of the output word file including

+ whether to include table of contents (`toc`)
+ the depth of table of contents (`toc_depth`)
+ whether to number sections or not (`number_sections`)
+ how to display plots and tables (`plots`, `tables`)
  + alignment (`align`)
  + prefix (`pre`), etc 

This is also where you specify what files you use as bibliography, citation style, among other things. Important ones will be introduced later. 

Here is an example YAML header, which you can see in `sample_to_word.rmd` file.

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/yaml-example.png")
```

More detailed explanation of output options will be provided later individually when the relevant topics are discussed.

### Main body

This is everything that is below the YAML header, where narratives and R codes are written.

## Control of some elements in WORD through Rmarkdown 

### Section, subsection, subsubsections

You can use `#`, `##`, `###` at the beginning of the line to define sections, subsections, and subsubsections.

```{r eval = F}
# This becomes section title

## This becomes subsection title

### This becomes subsubsection title
```

:::{.callout-note}
+ Confirm that `# Materials and Methods` and `## Data` in **sample_to_word.rmd** turn into a section and subsection title in **sample_to_word.docx**.
+ Note also that the sections and subsections are automatically numbered because `number_sections: true` in the YAML header.
:::

---

### Footnote

You can add a footnote using `^[]` like this:

```{r eval = F}
regular texts^[this is a footnote]
```

Footnotes are automatically numbered.

:::{.callout-note}
See the **Conclusion** section of **sample_to_word.rmd** and **sample_to_word.docx**. 
:::

---

### Line and page break

You can create a line break by inserting the following.

```markdown
<br>
```

:::{.callout-tip}
+ If `<br>` is placed in the same line as the one after which you want a break, then it does not give you a line break. Rather, put `<br>` in the next line.
+ Confirm this by inspecting the Materials and Methods section of the sample rmd and word files.
:::

To break a page, use
```{r, eval = F}
`r run_pagebreak()`
```

:::{.callout-note}
Confirm this by inspecting the end of the Introduction section of the sample rmd and word files.
:::


### List

You can create an unordered list by simply using either +, -, or * in front of each item. For example,

````{verbatim}
+ item 1
+ item 2
+ item 3
````

would print as below in the output WORD file.

+ item 1
+ item 2
+ item 3

You can create a nested list like below

````{verbatim}
+ item 1
  - item 1.1
  - item 1.2
+ item 2
+ item 3
````

would print as below in the output WORD file.

+ item 1
  - item 1.1
  - item 1.2
+ item 2
+ item 3

Here is an ordered list. 

````{verbatim}
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3
````

1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

### Bold and Italic

+ bold font: `**this becomes bold**` (or `__this becomes bold__`)
+ italic font: `*this becomes italic*` 

:::{.callout-note}
Confirm these by comparing the first sentence in the Introduction section of the sample rmd and WORD files.
:::

## Specifying the style of the output WORD file in detail {#sec-word-specify-style}

You can change the style of the output WORD file either via direct control in the YAML header or via reference WORD file. 

:::{.callout-tip}
+ You first change styles direclty using the options made available by the `officedown` package in the YAML header @sec-change-style-yaml
+ If the above is not sufficient, use reference WORD file to apply its style (not content) to the output WORD file @sec-change-style-reference
:::

### Change styles in the YAML header {#sec-change-style-yaml}

You can control the style of the output WORD file somewhat in the YAML header. For example, you can determine the page size and margins using `page_size` and `page_margins` (see the YAML header in the sample rmd file). You also have some controls on how tables and figures appear. For example, the `align` option lets you determine the horizontal position of tables and figures. `topcaption` lets you determine whether you have the caption at the top of bottom. 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/style-change-yaml.png")
```

:::{.callout-tip}
For the complete set of options, see [Section 4 of the Officeverse book](https://ardata-fr.github.io/officeverse/officedown-for-word.html).
:::

### Change styles through reference docx {#sec-change-style-reference}

It is almost always the case that the above approach is not sufficient to format your WORD file to the specific requirements of your target journal. In such a case, you can define the style of the output WORD file in detail using a style reference WORD file. This method can control virtually every aspect of WORD file styling. Some of the commonly customized elements among others are

+ font size
+ font family
+ line spacing

To do this, you first create a style reference word file that follows the style and format you would like the output WORD file to have. Then, add the following to the YAML header under **output:** like below.

```{md, eval = F}
output:
  reference_docx: word-style.docx
```

In our example project, **word_template.docx** is the reference file.
```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/yaml-reference-docx.png")
```

Of course, only the style and format of the reference WORD file will be inherited to the output WORD file, but not its contents.

:::{.callout-note}
+ Compared the style of **sample_to_word.docx** and "word_template.docx" and confirm they have the same font size and family for the narrative, sections, subsections, and subsubsection.
+ Uncomment `reference_docx: word_template.docx` in the YAML header, knit to a WORD file, and check the style of **sample_to_word.dcox** again
:::

You can change the style of the reference WORD style file and save the changes. Then, the style changes will be reflected in the output WORD file when the rmd file is knitted next time.

:::{.callout-tip}
To create a style file for your liking you may find [this Microsoft tutorial](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/customize-or-create-new-styles-d38d6e47-f6fc-48eb-a607-1eb120dec563) and [this book chapter](https://bookdown.org/yihui/Rmarkdown-cookbook/word-template.html) in @xie2020r useful. 
:::

### Style change example

This section gives you a quick look at what it may look to be changing the style of a reference WORD file. We use **word_template.docx** for this demonstration. First, open the document on WORD and open the Styles Pane (If you are using Mac, it should be at the right upper corner of the document). Then you should see something like below. 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/style-change-1.png")
```

Then, put your cursor on anywhere in line 2 as below and you should see that the current style is changed to "1 Heading 1", which is the name of the class (style type) the texts in line 2 belong to.

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/style-change-2.png")
```

Now, put your cursor at the black triangle and you should see available options including "Modify Style..."

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/style-change-3.png")
```

Once you click on it, you should see a pop-up window like below.

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/style-change-4.png")
```

Here, you can change font family, font size, among other things. In this demonstration, let's get rid of automatic section number. To do so, click on the "Format" button at the lower left corner of the window. Then, you should see this.

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/style-change-5.png")
```

Pick "Numbering," click on "None," and hit "OK." 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/style-change-6.png")
```

Hit "OK" again in the previous pop-up window, then you should see this.

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/style-change-7.png")
```

Notice that section numbering is now gone. Now, knit the sample rmd file and confirm that the output WORD file indeed lost section numbers (subsection numbers still remain because you did not modify that part in the reference docx.).

## Citations and References

### Set up

First, create a reference file. Then, add the following to the YAML header (not under **output:**).

```{r eval = F}
bibliography: bibliography file name
```

There are various bibliography systems that can be used including BibLaTeX/BibTex (.bib), CSL-JSON (.json), EndNote (.enl) among other.

<!-- ```{r echo = F}
data.frame(
  format = c("CSL-JSON", "MODS", "BibLaTeX/BibTex", "RIS", "EndNote", "EndNote XML", "ISI", "MEDLINE", "Copac"),
  extension = c(".json", ".mods", ".bib", ".ris", ".enl", ".xml", ".wos", ".medline", ".copac")
) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  fontsize(size = 18, part = "all") %>%
  autofit()
``` -->

Then, add the following to the part of rmd where you want to put references. 

````{verbatim}
::: {#refs}
:::
````

In our example, we use a **bib** file and the bibliography file is named **bibliography.bib** and specified in the YAML header as below

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/yaml-bib.png")
```

:::{.callout-note}
+ See the sample rmd file to see how bibliography file is specified in the YAML header
+ Confirm that `{#refs}` enclosed by `:::`is placed in the Reference section of the sample rmd file and confirm that references are indeed added in the Reference section of the output word file
:::

---

### Cite and create references

To cite, use the following syntax:

+ `@reference_name` to print "author names (year)" in the output WORD file
+ `[@reference_name]` to print "(author names, year)" in the output WORD file 
+ `[@reference_name_1; @reference_name_2]` to print "(author names, year; author names, year)" in the output WORD file 
+ `[-@reference_name]` to print just year

`reference_name` is the very first entry of a **.bib** file as in 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/bib-example.png")
```

If you are using CSL json file, then it is the **id** of an entry as in 

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/bib-csl-example.png")
```

The cited items are automatically added to the reference following the specified style (see the next section).

:::{.callout-note}
+ See the Introduction and Reference sections in the sample rmd and WORD files to confirm this rule.
+ Comment out `bibliography: bibliography.bib` and uncomment `bibliography: bibliography.csl`, knit again, and check citations and references are still there. This is just an illustration of using a different bibliography file (CSL json file). 
:::

---

### Citation and Reference Style

You can change the citation and reference style using [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/). Citation style files have **.csl** extension.

1. Obtain the csl file you would like to use from the [Zotero citation style repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles).

2. Place the following in the YAML header (not under **output:**):

```{r eval = F}
csl: csl file name 
```

3. Then, when knitted, citations and references styles reflect the style specified by the csl file  

Currently, the csl style should be set to **qje.csl** (citation style language for The Quarterly Journal of Economics) as below

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/yaml-csl.png")
```

Citation and references styles in the output WORD file follows the rules for the QJE.

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="minimal"}
```{r, echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
#| layout-ncol: 1
#| fig-cap:
#|   - "Citation style for QJE"
#|   - "Reference style for QJE"
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/citation-qje.png")
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/reference-qje.png")
```
:::



Now, comment `csl: qje.csl` and uncomment `csl: pnas.csl` so that the CSL for the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) is used, and then knit the sample rmd file. 

You can now see that the citation style no longer respects the rules I mentioned above and also the reference style follows that of PNAS. This is because PNAS uses only numbers, but not author names or years.

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="minimal"}
```{r, echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
#| layout-ncol: 1
#| fig-cap:
#|   - "Citation style for PNAS"
#|   - "Reference style for PNAS"
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/citation-pnas.png")
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/reference-pnas.png")
```
:::


## Cross-referenced Tables

1. Create a table using the `flextable` package (this is not the only option, and will be discussed later) 

2. Add an R code chunk like this:

````markdown
`r ''````{r, tab.id = "table-id", tab.cap = "table-name"}
table_ft
```
````

* `table_ft` is a `flextable` object.
* `table-name` is the caption of the table in the output WORD file
* `table-id` is the table id you can use to cross-reference

3. Use `\@ref(tab:table-id)` in the Rmarkdown file to cross-reference the table (table numbering in the output WORD file is automatic)

:::{.callout-important}
You cannot use `_` in the table id (`-` is allowed). Cross-referencing would not work with if the table id includes `_`.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
+ See the Tables section of the sample rmd for the R codes to create a table using the `flextable` package and confirm that the table appears in the output WORD files
+ See the bottom of the Data subsection under the Materials and Methods section to confirm that cross-referencing is working.
:::

### Packages to create tables

One of the disadvantages of writing to a WORD file is that some table-making R packages are not compatible with it. The `flextable` package is written by the same author of the `officedown` package, which we are using to write to a WORD file. So, naturally, a table object created by the `flextable` package (a `flextable` object) can be knitted into the output WORD without (almost) any hiccups as we saw earlier. A notable R package that does NOT work well with the output class of `officedown::rdocx_document` (which we are using) is the `gt` package. Tables created by the package is an object of class `gt`. Unfortunately, there is no function that lets you convert an `gt` object to a `flextable` object as of now. 

One of the recommended packages is the [`modelsummary`](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/index.html) package (especially for those who often include regression results tables and summary statistics tables). It lets you create regression results tables via the `modelsummary()` function and summary statistics tables via the `datasummary()` function^[The [gtsummary](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/index.html) package is also compatible. Use `as_flex_table()` to convert a `gtsummary` object to a `flextable` object.]. Both functions has an option called `output` and you can use `output = "flextable"` to generate tables as `flextable` objects, which can then be included in the output file easily. 

Here are some example R codes of using the `modelsummary` package to create a regression results and summary statistics tables.

**Regression** table

```{r, eval = F}
#--- regressions ---#
lm_1 <- fixest::feols(mpg ~ hp + cyl, data = mtcars)
lm_2 <- fixest::feols(mpg ~ hp + cyl + wt, data = mtcars)
lm_3 <- fixest::feols(mpg ~ hp + cyl + wt, cluster = ~ vs, data = mtcars)

#--- create a regression results table ---#
modelsummary::modelsummary(
  list(lm_1, lm_2, lm_3),
  output = "flextable",
  gof_omit = "IC|Log|Adj|F|Pseudo|Within"
) %>%
  autofit() %>%
  hline(8) # add horizontal line. modelsummary() adds horizontal line separating coefficient estimates and model summary statistics. But, it disappears on WORD for some reason. So, it is manually added here.
```

**Summary statistics** table

```{r, eval = F}
modelsummary::datasummary(
  mpg + hp + cyl ~ Mean + SD,
  data = mtcars,
  output = "flextable"
)
```

[Here](https://tmieno2.github.io/AECN-Data-Science-R/Chapter-7-MakeTable_flextable/make_table_flextable_x.html?panelset6=instruction5&panelset7=instruction6&panelset8=introduction2&panelset9=instruction7&panelset10=add_*_row%28%292&panelset11=instruction8#1) is one of the resources to learn how to use the `flextable` package if you need to further modify the tables created by the `modelsummary()` and `datasummary()` functions.

:::{.callout-note}
See how the exactly the same codes above in the sample rmd file translates into the regression results and summary statistics tables in the output word file.
:::

## Cross-referenced Figures

### Figures created internally

You can create plots within an rmarkdown file and display them in the output WORD file. Here are the steps.

1. Create a plot using R

2. Add an R code chunk like this:
  * `figure_g` is a plot.
  * `fig.cap = "caption"` adds `caption` as the caption of the figure 
  * `figure-id` is the figure id used for cross-referencing

````markdown
`r ''````{r, fig.id = "figure-id", fig.cap = "caption"}
figure_g 
```
````

3. Use `\@ref(fig:figure-id)` in the Rmarkdown file to cross-reference the figure (figure numbering in the output WORD file is automatic)

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="minimal" collapse="true"}
## Rmarkdown-WORD Comparison: Visual Example
<br>

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
#| layout-ncol: 1
#| fig-cap:
#|   - "Rmarkdown"
#|   - "WORD"
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/figure-rmd.png")
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/figure-word.png")
```
:::

:::{.callout-important}
+ Please do not forget to have `fig.cap = "caption"` in the R code chunk option that output a plot. Otherwise, the plot will not be recognized as a plot in the output WORD file and cross-referencing will not work even though the plot will be displayed (check to confirm this by removing `fig.cap = "The Distribution of Yield by Zone"` from the R code chunk in the Figures secdion of the sample WORD file). 
+ You cannot use `_` in the figure id (`-` is allowed). Cross-referencing would not work with if the table id includes `_`.
:::

You can control the size of the plots in the output WORD file, using the `fig.width` and `fig.height` options in the R code chunk. For example, `fig.width = 4` would mean that the width of the plot will be 4 inches. Use the `dpi` option to control the resolution of the plot. The higher the `dpi` value, the sharper the plot is.

:::{.callout-note}
## Try
+ Change `fig.width` to 2 and see what happens to the output WORD file.
+ Remove the `fig.cap` option and see what happens to the output WORD file.
+ Change the `dpi` value to 100 see what happens to the output WORD file.
:::


### Importing pre-made figures

Instead of creating plots using R code inside an Rmarkdown, we often need to import figures that were made elsewhere. You may be importing your company/university logos. You may have created plots using the `ggplot2` package and saved them as pictures. In order to import a pre-made figure and cross-reference it, you can use `knitr::include_graphics()` as follows,


````{verbatim}
```{r  echo = F, fig.id = "figure-id", fig.cap = "figure caption"}
knitr::include_graphics("file name")
```
````

You can cross-reference imported figures in the same manner as the R-generated figures as shown above. 

:::{.callout-note icon=false appearance="minimal" collapse="true"}
## Rmarkdown-WORD Comparison: Visual Example
<br>

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
#| layout-ncol: 1
#| fig-cap:
#|   - "Rmarkdown"
#|   - "WORD"
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/figure-rmd-import.png")
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/figure-word-import.png")
```
:::

It is important to note that pdf files are not accepted^[If you are using Rmarkdown-PDF, you can import pdf files]. One of the accepted files types is `.png` (or `jpg`)^[I am not aware of all the types of accepted file types.]. So, if you are creating figures outside of the Rmarkdown file, save it as a `png` file.

In order to change the size of the imported figure, you can use the same R chunk option of `fig.width` and `fig.height` as the internally created plots. However, you cannot control the resolution of the imported figure using `dpi` (naturally) because the resolution of the saved image will be respected. If you are using R to create a plot, you can set its dpi when saving it. For example, if you are using `ggplot2`, you can the `dpi` option in `ggsave()` will do the job.


:::{.callout-note}
## Try!
+ Change `fig.width = 3` to see its effect on the output WORD file
+ Change `dpi = 600` in the R code chunk for the second figure to confirmt that it does not anything
:::


## Mathematical equations

You can use Latex-like math syntax to write mathematical equations. For equation numbering and cross-referencing to work as discussed here, make sure that you use `bookdown::word_document2` for the `base_format` in the YAML header as below.

```{r  echo = F, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/pictures/yaml-math.png")
```


### Math equation 

Math for WORD output is much limited compared to writing to a PDF file using Latex (when knitting to a PDF file, Rmarkdown uses Latex to render math equations). This is because Latex is **NOT** involved in converting Latex-like math syntax to math equations when knitted to WORD. Instead, pandoc is doing the conversion job. So, it is not surprising that not all the Latex math capabilities can be utilized when knitting to a WORD file. With that said, most of the syntaxes that you will need are the same between Rmd-to-WORD and Latex. You can use the equation (for single line of math) and align (more than equal to one equations) environments with successful cross-referencing.

---

**equation** environment

To use an equation environment, first write math and then put `(\#eq:equation-id)` at the end (but before `\end{equation}`) to give an equation id to the equation. You can use `\@ref(eq:equation-id)` to cross-reference the equation. 

````markdown
\begin{equation}
Math
(\#eq:equation-id)
\end{equation}
````

For example,

```markdown
\begin{equation}
\bar{y} = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i
(\#eq:eq-1)
\end{equation}
```

should print like below in the output WORD file.

$$
\begin{equation}
\bar{y} = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i
\end{equation}
$$

**align** environment

This works just like **equation** environment. To use an align environment, first write line(s) of math and then put `(\#eq:equation-id)` at the end (but before `\end{align}`) to give an equation id to the equation. You can use `\@ref(eq:equation-id)` to cross-reference the equation. 

````markdown
\begin{align}
Math\\ 
Math
(\#eq:equation-id)
\end{align}
````

For example,

```markdown
\begin{align}
 AR(p): Y_i &= c + \epsilon_i + \phi_i Y_{i-1} \dots \\
 Y_{i} &= c + \phi_i Y_{i-1} \dots
\end{align}
```

should print like below in the output WORD file.

$$
\begin{align}
 AR(p): Y_i &= c + \epsilon_i + \phi_i Y_{i-1} \dots \\
 Y_{i} &= c + \phi_i Y_{i-1} \dots
\end{align}
$$

### In-line math

To write a mathematical expression in line, you can enclose math expressions by $ like below.

````markdown
Our model is written as $Y_z = f_z(S) + g_z(N) + h_z(X,Y) + \varepsilon_z$.
````

This should appear like below in the output WORD file.

Our model is written as $Y_z = f_z(S) + g_z(N) + h_z(X,Y) + \varepsilon_z$.
